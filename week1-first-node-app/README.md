## Description

This project demonstrates creating a basic HTTP server using Node.js. When you run the server, it responds with a plain text message "Hello, World! This is my first node js app".

## How to run

1. Make sure Node.js is installed on your system.
2. Open terminal or command prompt in the project folder.
3. Run the command: `node app.js`
4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` to see the message.
